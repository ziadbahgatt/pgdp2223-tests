//#D should throw error when trying to store to negative address
//#! ERR

// EDITOR'S NOTE:
// there is no preset message for this scenario in the template
// for this reason, the test doesn't check for a specific error message
// however, this case should NOT be allowed according to the docs
// thanks, and happy bugfixing!
